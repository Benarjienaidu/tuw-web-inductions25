# Team Unwired Web Developer Inductions
You may pick either or both tasks

1. Create a simple website for Team Unwired to showcase its achievements and attract sponsorship. You may refer to https://aaronthomasbabu.github.io/teamunwired.org/ (but do not copy it!). We will judge you based on your quality of code, ability to use git, and GitHub. Bonus points if you host, and use a framework other than React, such as Svelte and Solidjs. Additional tip: use lighthouse to evaluate performance
2. Create a design mockup for Team Unwired's website, in Figma or whatever tool youre comfortable with. The hero page should contain the model of a Formula Student car. As you scroll, the model."blows up" to reveal its internal components. Code is not necessary, but we will definitely induct you if you do implement this in code. We will judge you based on the vibe and adherence to the TUW color scheme.
3. If you feel your resume speaks enough, you can come directly to the interview (will be informed in the group) with a copy of your resume. If we feel you have enough experience, you are in.

You will have one week to submit the tasks. Fork this repo, and make a PR when you're ready to submit. 
Use of generative AI is permitted - we'll be making sure you know what YOU did, and can explain it.
